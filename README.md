<h2>Baseline Protocol Improvement Proposal (BLIPs)</h2>

Have an idea to make Baseline even better? Want to propose your ideas to the Baseline community, and work with others to implement your idea? **Submit a BLIP!**
It's even possible to be paid for your BLIP work through grants. All you have to do after opening a BLIP is apply for grand funds through the link below in the resources section.

As an open source protocol, the Baseline community powers the standard! These BLIPs ensure innovative ideas don't get left behind.

The purpose of this repo is to collect, organize, prioritize, and track the progress of improvements to the Baseline Protocol codebase and standard through BLIPs.

Use the [BLIP template](https://github.com/eea-oasis/baseline-blips/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/blip-template.md) to submit an improvement proposal. This template is modeled based on the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) format.

BLIPs will be tracked through Issues. An open BLIP should have its labels updated when necessary to accuratly respresent the status. Regular updates should be given through the issues comment section. BLIPs will be reviewed during Core Dev meetings to discuss status and next-steps.

BLIPs will also be tracked through Projects, to provide a visual board representation of the overall status.
