<h2>Baseline Protocol Improvement Proposal (BLIPs)</h2>

This repo is used to collect, organize, prioritize, and track progress on improvements to the Baseline Protocol codebase and standard.


Have an idea on how to make the Baseline Protocol even better? Want to propose your ideas to the Baseline community, and work with others to implement your idea? **Submit a BLIP!**
As an open source protocol, the Baseline community powers the standard! These BLIPs ensure innovative ideas don't get left behind.

It's even possible to be paid for your BLIP work through grants. All you have to do after opening a BLIP is submit a [Grant Application Here](https://github.com/eea-oasis/baseline-grants)

The purpose of this repo is to collect, organize, prioritize, and track the progress of improvements to the Baseline Protocol codebase and standard through BLIPs.

## Process

Use the [BLIP template](https://github.com/eea-oasis/baseline-blips/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/blip-template.md) to submit an improvement proposal. This template is modeled based on the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) format.

BLIPs will be tracked through [Issues](https://github.com/eea-oasis/baseline-blips/issues).

- An open BLIP should have its labels updated when necessary to accuratly respresent the status.
- Regular updates should be given through the issues comment section.
- BLIPs will be reviewed during the bi-weekly [Baseline Core Dev meetings](https://www.baseline-protocol.org/get-involved/) to discuss status and next steps.

BLIPs will also be tracked through [Projects](https://github.com/eea-oasis/baseline-blips/projects/1) to provide a visual representation of all of the efforts.
